Overview
Legal Hub is a multi-user static web platform designed to empower law students, practicing lawyers, and the general public through centralized access to learning resources, legal news, and professional connections. The application is built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—no external libraries or backend—making it lightweight, secure, and easily deployable for hackathon projects and demonstrations.
